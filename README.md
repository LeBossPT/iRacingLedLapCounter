iRacing doesn't tell you how many laps a lower-class car led a multi-class race...
You may manage to determine this individually on a 1-hour race, but on a 12 or 24-hours 600-laps race? Forget it!

This is the reason I created this specific json handler!

To download the json file you need, you must go to the desired results page, select lap graph or chart and: "Download Lap Data" "The content of this results set needs to be downloaded to view. Click below to download." "Download Data".
